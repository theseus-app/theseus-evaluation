Study Period: The overall study period was from 19 October 2010 (coinciding with initial approval of dabigatran) to 31 December 2018.

TAR: The primary on-treatment time-at-risk period was defined as the time from 1 day after the anticoagulant index date to the end of inferred persistent exposure, the last day of observation, or the end of the study period, whichever came first. 

PS Settings:  Propensity scores (PSs) were used to reduce potential confounding due to an imbalance of observed patient characteristics at baseline and were calculated for each patient using the predicted probability from a regularized logistic regression model, fit with a Laplace prior (LASSO) and the regularization hyperparameter selected by optimizing the likelihood in a tenfold cross validation. The primary PS strategy matched the target to comparator patients in a 1:1 ratio
