TAR: The OT TAR was calculated from the index date of the first exposure to the end of treatment, based on days’ supply, allowing for up to 30-day gaps between the end of days’ supply and the start of the next prescription. 

PS Settings: A PS was estimated for each subject using the predicted probability from a regularized logistic regression model, fit with a Laplace prior (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and the regularization hyperparameter selected by optimizing the likelihood in a ten-fold cross validation, using a starting variance of 0.01 and a tolerance of 2e−7. Subjects were matched on 1:1 ratio of target to comparator subjects. This approach used a greedy matching algorithm by applying a caliper of 0.2 of the standard deviation on the logit scale of the PS distribution

Outcome Model: In this study, we compared target cohorts with the comparator cohorts for the hazards of O1 or O2 during the TAR by applying a Cox proportional hazards model conditioned on PSs.
