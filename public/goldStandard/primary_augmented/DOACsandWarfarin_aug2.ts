Study Period: The overall study period was from 19 October 2010 to the end of available observation.

TAR: The intention-to-treat time-at-risk period was defined as the time from 3 days after the anticoagulant index date to 365 days after the anticoagulant index date.

PS Settings: Propensity scores (PSs) were used to reduce potential confounding due to an imbalance of observed patient characteristics at baseline and were calculated for each patient using the predicted probability from a regularized logistic regression model, fit with a Laplace prior (LASSO) and the regularization hyperparameter selected by optimizing the likelihood in a tenfold cross validation. The primary PS strategy stratified patients on the propensity score

Outcome Model: Logistic regression models were used to model the first outcome occurrence for the target relative to the comparator cohort in pairwise comparisons
