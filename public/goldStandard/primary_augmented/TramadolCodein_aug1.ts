Study Period: The study period was from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2018.

TAR: The ITT TAR was calculated from the index date of the first exposure to 30 days after the first exposure.

PS Settings: A PS was estimated for each subject using the predicted probability from a regularized logistic regression model, fit with a Laplace prior (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and the regularization hyperparameter selected by optimizing the likelihood in a ten-fold cross validation, using a starting variance of 0.01 and a tolerance of 2e-7. Subjects were matched on variable ratio of target to comparator subjects, with a maximum ratio of 1:10. This approach used a greedy matching algorithm by applying a caliper of 0.2 of the standard deviation on the logit scale of the PS distribution

Outcome Model: In this study, we compared target cohorts with the comparator cohorts for the rates of O1 or O2 during the TAR by applying a Poisson regression model conditioned on PSs.
