Study Period: Included all data available for observation

TAR: "Intention-to-treat” time at risk in the cohort for which they first qualified, starting 31 days after they entered that cohort until  the first of:  365 days after cohort entry, having the study outcome (see in the following sections), reaching the end of insurance enrollment, or reaching the end of the study. For both cohorts being compared, patients were required to have continuous observation after the time-at-risk start.

PS Settings: the large-scale regularized regression model involving PS estimation (adapted PS strategy) using predicted probability from a large-scale regularized logistic regression model, fit with a Laplace prior (LASSO) using all observed covariates, including a recent diagnosis of dementia as input and PS stratification using deciles.

Outcome Model: The ORs for the outcome during the time-at-risk was estimated by applying a logistic regression model conditioned on the PS strata.
