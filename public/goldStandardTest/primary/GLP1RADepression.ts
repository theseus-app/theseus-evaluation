Study Period: We emulated the target trial using U.S. national Medicare administrative claims data between January 2013 and December 2020

TAR: The patients were followed from the index date until the diagnosis of depression; death; disenrollment from Medicare Part A, B, or D; up to 2 years of follow-up; or the end of the study (31 December 2020), whichever came first

PS Settings: The statistical analyses were the same as for the target trial except that 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching was used to mitigate potential confounding. The PS was estimated using multivariate logistic regression models incorporating baseline covariates. We applied nearest-neighbor matching without replacement, using a maximum caliper width of 0.05, to construct the matched cohort.

Outcome Model: To test the robustness of the study findings, we used a Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard model to address the competing risk for death, which allows a more accurate estimation of the cumulative incidence of the outcome in the presence of a competing event (death) that precludes the occurrence of the event of interest.
