Study Period: Before applying the eligibility criteria, we identified persons who filled a new prescription for first-line SGLT-2i (canagliflozin, empagliflozin, or dapagliflozin) or metformin between 1 April 2013 (consistent with the launch of SGLT2i in the United States) and 31 March 2020 in Optum.

TAR: Follow-up began on the day after cohort entry and continued until the occurrence of a study outcome, death, treatment discontinuation (with an interval between prescription refills >60 days) (29), disenrollment, or end of the study period, whichever occurred first.

PS Settings: We chose the ratio of 1:2 for matching to improve statistical efficiency because the number of metformin initiators was much larger
compared with SGLT-2i initiators. 

Outcome Model: Within each database, time block–specific PSmatched cohorts were aggregated for outcome regression and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using proportional hazards models without further adjustment.
